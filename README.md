### Project Title: US City Bike Data Analysis

### Description
<<<<<<< HEAD
This project provides data on bike usage and trips within three major cities (New York City, Chicago, and Washington).  Users have the ability to choose a city to analyze and filter that city's data set by month and/or day of the week. Users are provided various statistics related to bike usage including most time statistics, most common start and stop station combinations, gender breakdowns of riders, and various rider age statistics.  
R: This script can adapt to different city data sets in a similar format
>>>>>>> refactoring

### Files used
This project uses one python script file (bikeshare_2.py) and three data files: 'chicago.csv', 'new_york_city.csv', and 'washington.csv'. Note that there are differences in the data between these files. Washington lacks birth or gender column data sets. There is also a "references.rtf" file describing various sources used in this project. This script is flexible enough for additional cities to be added as well. 


### Credits
Credit is owed to the Udacity reviewing team for noting an exception error thrown when Washington was analyzed for certain data sets it was missing. 
Credit owed to my Udacity reviewer for helping me understand proper commit language.
